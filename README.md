Poké Capstone

Welcome to my Pokémon dojo! This project will use datasets to compare competitive Pokémon data. This will also allow you to see the type(s), movesets, abilities, and base stats (HP, ATK, etc.) of the Pokémon to help with crafting a competitive team of your own! You'll be able to do this be sorting by specific Pokémon type, abilities, or even by the move itself. 

What if you're looking for a bulky defensive Pokémon to complement your quick physical sweeper Pokémon? Look no further as you can check out the base stats of Pokémon to pick the right partner to start your team.
